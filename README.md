# Walmart-Advertising-Effectiveness-Analysis-in-R

This project investigates how advertising investments in TV, Radio, and Newspaper impact product sales using R programming. The analysis begins with loading and cleaning the dataset using read.csv(). I visualized the distribution and relationships using ggplot2 to uncover patterns in sales versus each advertising medium. Correlation analysis using the cor() function revealed that TV and Radio have a stronger positive relationship with sales than Newspaper. To further quantify these insights, I built multiple linear regression models using the lm() function. Model summaries helped interpret coefficients, p-values, and R-squared values, indicating the predictive power of each advertising channel. Residual diagnostics were also performed to check model assumptions. The outcome suggested TV and Radio are more effective in driving sales, aiding marketers in optimizing their ad budget allocation.
